Blackhole is a `Tornado`_ powered MTA (mail transport agent) that is designed
for handling large volumes of email without handling any of the messages and
doing no disk bound I/O.

.. _Tornado: http://www.tornadoweb.org/

Blackhole is designed mostly for testing purposes and can be used to test
numerous things suchs as;

- Email send rates, if you need to test how much mail you can send per minute,
  hour etc
- Email integration testing and finally
- if you work in the real world, chances are you'll need work on a copy of
  production data from time to time. You can try to anonymous all the data but
  there is always a chance you'll miss something. Configuring blackhole as
  your applications default SMTP gateway will remove any chance of a real
  person receiving an email they shouldn't have received.

Using the blackhole.io service
==============================

All data sent to blackhole.io will be forgotten instantly, we store nothing
you send.

1. Point your application's outgoing SMTP server to 'blackhole.io',
2. Sit back and watch mail never get delivered to a real user.

or, send an email to blackhole.io using an @blackhole.io address, any
address is fine e.g.::

    user1@blackhole.io

Testing via telnet

    $ telnet blackhole 25

Testing STARTTLS
----------------

::

    $ openssl s_client -starttls smtp -connect blackhole.io:465

Testing with Python
-------------------

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    import smtplib

    msg = """From: <user@address.tld>
    To: <someone@another.tld>
    Subject: Test

    gwergerg
    """

    server = smtplib.SMTP('blackhole.io', 25)
    server.sendmail("user@address.tld", "someone@another.tld",
                    msg)
    server.quit()

Running your own server
=======================

Python versions
---------------

::

    Python 2.6
    Python 2.7
    Python 3.2
    Python 3.3
    PyPy 1.9      # see notes below
    PyPy 2.0      # see notes below

Blackhole works on Python 2.6 and 2.7, it also works with PyPy
(see :ref:`blackhole-pypy` section below).

Third party libraries
---------------------

::

    tornado>=2.2.1,<=3.1
    setproctitle>=1.1.6   # setproctitle 1.1.7 and above are required for
                          # all PyPy versions
    deiman>=0.1.5         # older version of Deiman will not work because of
                          #API changes

FQDN
----

The FQDN that Blackhole will print on a new connection is automatically
generated.

It will use the contents of `/etc/mailname`, if that file does not exist it
will use a name returned by `socket.getfqdn()`.

Tests & Coverage
================

Running tests manually
----------------------

Running tests manually is pretty simple, there is a Make target dedicated to
it.

The test suite relies on `unittest2` and `nose`, both if which get installed by
the Make target during test running.

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

There is also a Make target for generating coverage

.. code-block:: bash

    make coverage

Third party CI/Coverage
-----------------------

.. image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/kura/blackhole.png?branch=master
        :target: https://travis-ci.org/kura/blackhole

.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/kura/blackhole/badge.png?branch=master
        :target: https://coveralls.io/r/kura/blackhole

You can find the latest build status on `travis`_.

.. _blackhole-pypy:

Blackhole + PyPy
================

`PyPy`_ is a Python interpreter and just-in-time compiler. PyPy focuses on
speed, efficiency and compatibility with the original CPython interpreter.

.. _PyPy: http://pypy.org/

Blackhole works well under PyPy 1.9, 2.0 beta1 and 2.0 beta2, you can see
performance improvements of up to 30% in certain situations.

However, blackhole does have issues with both PyPy 1.9 and 2.0 beta1 and 2.0
beta2 when using the pre-compiled binaries, this is due to a conflict in the
version of OpenSSL compiled in to PyPy and the version compiled in to your
CPython installation.
If you wish to use blackhole with SSL support on PyPy I suggest you either
compile PyPy yourself or try to make sure your PyPy and CPython have the same
versions.

FAQ
===

A few people have emailed me questions about why blackhole exists, how I use
it, why Tornado and things like that
so I have outlined some questions and responses in an :ref:`faq`.
