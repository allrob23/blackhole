Debug Flag
==========

After much debate and several emails from developers a debug flag has been
added to blackhole.

You can enable debug using command line options :ref:`configuration-options`
or via the configuration file :ref:`configuration-file-example`.

Enabling the debug flag will log all incoming and outgoing commands to the
blackhole log file as well as all data sent after a `DATA` command.

Each connection/email gets it's own unique identifier, this indentifier
uses only hexidecimal characters and is 10 character in length, which means
at some point the identifier will be reused.
